	Access Control List (ACL)
	    A list of permissions attached to an object. An ACL specifies which
	    users or system processes are granted access to objects, as well as
	    what operations are allowed on given objects. Each entry in a
	    typical ACL specifies a subject and an operation.

	Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE)
	    An intrusion detection system for checking the integrity of files
	    under Linux. AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) can be
	    used to help track file integrity by comparing a snapshot of the
	    system's files prior to and after a suspected incident. It is
	    maintained by Rami Lehti and Pablo Virolainen.

	Auditd
	    auditd is the userspace component to the Linux Auditing System. It's
	    responsible for writing audit records to the disk. Viewing the logs is
	    done with the ausearch or aureport utilities. Configuring the audit
	    rules is done with the auditctl utility. During startup, the rules in
	    /etc/audit/audit.rules are read by auditctl. The audit daemon itself
	    has some configuration options that the admin may wish to customize.
	    They are found in the auditd.conf file.

	Community Enterprise Operating System (CentOS)
	    An Enterprise-grade Operating System that is directly compatible
	    with a prominent US Linux distribution.

	Domain Name System (DNS)
	    A database system that translates a computer's fully qualified
	    domain name into an IP address and the reverse.

	Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
	    A network protocol that enables a server to automatically assign an
	    IP address to a computer.

	Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
	    A domain name that specifies its exact location in the tree
	    hierarchy of the Domain Name System (DNS). It specifies all domain
	    levels, including the top-level domain and the root zone. An FQDN is
	    distinguished by its unambiguity; it can only be interpreted one
	    way.

	Hard Disk Drive (HDD)
	    A device for storing and retrieving digital information, primarily
	    computer data.

	Internet Protocol Tables (IPtables)

	    A user space application that provides an interface to the IPv6
	    firewall rules on modern Linux systems.

	Kerberos (Krb5)
	    A computer network authentication protocol that works on the basis
	    of "tickets" to allow nodes communicating over a non-secure network
	    to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner.

	Key Distribution Center (KDC)
	    Part of a cryptosystem intended to reduce the risks inherent in
	    exchanging keys. KDCs often operate in systems within which some
	    users may have permission to use certain services at some times and
	    not at others.

	    A tool that provides parallel versions of OpenSSH and other related
	    tools.

	Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)
	    A mechanism to integrate multiple low-level authentication schemes
	    into a high-level application programming interface (API). It allows
	    programs that rely on authentication to be written independent of
	    the underlying authentication scheme.

	Practical Extraction and Report Language (PERL)
	    A high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming
	    language. Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a
	    general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing
	    easier.

	    public-key of a specific certificate. This is also the format used
	    for Certificate Authority certificates.

	Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
	    A security architecture that has been introduced to provide an
	    increased level of confidence for exchanging information over an
	    increasingly insecure Internet. PKI enables users of a basically
	    insecure public networks, such as the Internet, to securely
	    authenticate to systems and exchange data. The exchange of data is
	    done by using a combination of cryptographically bound public and
	    private keys.

	Puppet
	      A Open Source configuration management tool written and maintained
	      by `Puppet Labs <http://www.puppetlabs.com>`__. Written as a Ruby
	      DSL, Puppet provides a declarative language that allows system
	      administrators to provide a consistently applied management
	      infrastructure. Users describes system resource and resource state
	      either in the Puppet language. Puppet discovers system specific
	      information via facter and compiles Puppet manifests into a system
	      specific catalog containing resources and resource dependencies
	      which are applied to each client system.

	Random Access Memory (RAM)
	    A form of computer data storage. A random access device allows
	    stored data to be accessed in nearly the same amount of time for any
	    storage location, so data can be accessed quickly in any random
	    order.

	Red Hat
	    A collection of many different software programs, developed by Red
	    Hat速, Inc. and other members of the Open Source community. All
	    software programs included in Red Hat速nux速 are GPG signed by Red Hat
	    to indicate that Red Hat supplied them.

	    See also RHEL.

	Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
	    A commercial Linux operating system produced by Red Hat速, Inc. RHEL
	    is designed to provide an Enterprise-ready Linux distribution
	    suitable to multiple taret applications.

	    See also Red Hat Linux.

	Resource Package Manager (RPM)
	    A package management system. The name RPM is associated with the
	    .rpm file format, files in this format, software packaged in such
	    files, and the package manager itself. RPM was developed primarily
	    for GNU/Linux distributions; the file format is the baseline package
	    format of the Linux Standard Base.

	RSA
	    An algorithm for public-key cryptography that is based on the
	    presumed difficulty of factoring large integers, the factoring
	    problem. RSA stands for Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman,
	    who first publicly described it in 1977.

	Ruby
	    A dynamic, reflective, general-purpose object-oriented programming
	    language that combines syntax inspired by Perl with Smalltalk-like
	    features. Ruby originated in Japan during the mid-1990s and was
	    first developed and designed by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto. It was
	    influenced primarily by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, and Lisp. Ruby
	    supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional,
	    object oriented, imperative and reflective. It also has a dynamic
	    type system and automatic memory management; it is therefore similar
	    in varying respects to Smalltalk, Python, Perl, Lisp, Dylan, Pike,
	    and CLU.

	Secure Shell (SSH)
	    An application for secure data communication, remote shell services,
	    or command execution between networked computers. SSH utilitizes a
	    server/client model for point-to-point secure communication.

	SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)
	    A network protocol that provides file access, file transfer, and
	    file management functionalities over any reliable data stream. It
	    was designed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as an
	    extension of the Secure Shell protocol (SSH) version 2.0 to provide
	    secure file transfer capability, but is also intended to be usable
	    with other protocols.

	Sudosh
	    A filter that can be used as a login shell.

	Transport Layer Security (TSL)
	    A cryptographic protocol that provides network communications
	    security. TLS and SSL encrypt the segments of network connections
	    above the Transport Layer, using asymmetric cryptography for privacy
	    and a keyed message authentication codes for message reliability.

	    See also SSL.

	Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)
	    A file transfer protocol generally used for automated transfer of
	    configuration or boot files between machines in a local environment.

	TTY
	    A Unix command that prints to standard output the name of the
	    terminal connected to standard input. The name of the program comes
	    from teletypewriter, abbreviated "TTY".

	    A completely isolated guest operating system installation within a
	    normal host operating system.

	Virtual Network Computing (VNC)
	    A graphical desktop sharing system that uses the remote framebuffer
	    (RFB) protocol to control another computer remotely. It transmits
	    the keyboard and mouse events from one computer to another, relaying
	    the graphical screen updates back in the other direction, over a
	    network.

	Wide Area Network (WAN)
	    A computer networking technology used to transmit ata over long
	    distances, and between different Local Area Networks (LANs),
