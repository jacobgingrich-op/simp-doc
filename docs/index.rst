Welcome to SIMP's documentation!
================================

    This is the &SIMP_VERSION;-&SIMP_RELEASE; release of the SIMP
    product based on the &RHEL_VERSION; release of CentOS and Red Hat
    Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

    SIMP is a minimized, security-focused, continually managed
    operating system overlay compatible with RHEL and CentOS. Each
    system is tailored to the hosted project's needs using Puppet.
 
    Fundamentally, SIMP is a framework that is designed to be secure
    from a practical point of view out of the box. As a framework,
    SIMP is designed to be flexed to meet the needs of the end user.
    If, for some reason, this is not possible, then this should be
    reported to the developers as a bug.
