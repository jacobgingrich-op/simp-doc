	Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE)
	    An intrusion detection system for checking the integrity of files
	    under Linux. AIDE can be used to help track file integrity by
	    comparing a snapshot of the system's files prior to and after a
	    suspected incident. It is maintained by Rami Lehti and Pablo
	    Virolainen.

	Central Processing Unit (CPU)
	    The hardware within a computer system that carries out the
	    instructions of a computer program by performing the basic
	    arithmetical, logical, and input/output operations of the system.

	Community Enterprise Operating System (CentOS)
	    An Enterprise-grade Operating System that is directly compatible
	    with a prominent US Linux distribution.

	Domain Name System (DNS)
	    A database system that translates a computer's fully qualified
	    domain name into an IP address and the reverse.

	Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
	    A network protocol that enables a server to assign an IP address to
	    a computer automatically.

	Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
	    A domain name that specifies its exact location in the tree
	    hierarchy of the Domain Name System (DNS). It specifies all domain
	    levels, including the top-level domain and the root zone. An FQDN is
	    distinguished by its unambiguity; it can only be interpreted one
	    way.

	Hard Disk Drive (HDD)
	    A device for storing and retrieving digital information, primarily
	    computer data.

	Internet Protocol Tables (IPtables)
	    A user space application that provides an interface to the IPv4
	    firewall rules on modern Linux systems.

	Internet Protocol 6 Tables (IP6tables)
	    A user space application that provides an interface to the IPv6
	    firewall rules on modern Linux systems.

	Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
	    A protocol for querying and modifying LDAP directory services
	    including information such as names, addresses, email, phone
	    numbers, and other information from an online directory.

	Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)
	    A mechanism to integrate multiple low-level authentication schemes
	    into a high-level application programming interface (API). It allows
	    programs that rely on authentication to be written independent of
	    the underlying authentication scheme.

	Preboot Execution Environment (PXE)
	    An environment to boot computers using a network interface
	    independently of data storage devices (like hard disks) or installed
	    operating systems.

	Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM)
	    An early standard for securing electronic mail. This is the
	    public-key of a specific certificate. This is also the format used
	    for Certificate Authority certificates.

	Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
	    A security architecture that has been introduced to provide an
	    increased level of confidence for exchanging information over an
	    increasingly insecure Internet. PKI enables users of a basically
	    insecure public networks, such as the Internet, to securely
	    authenticate to systems and exchange data. The exchange of data is
	    done by using a combination of cryptographically bound public and
	    private keys.

	Puppet
	    An Open Source configuration management tool written and maintained
	    by `Puppet Labs <http://www.puppetlabs.com>`__. Written as a Ruby
	    DSL, Puppet provides a declarative language that allows system
	    administrators to provide a consistently applied management
	    infrastructure. Users describes system resource and resource state
	    either in the Puppet language. Puppet discovers system specific
	    information via facter and compiles Puppet manifests into a system
	    specific catalog containing resources and resource dependencies
	    which are applied to each client system.

	Random Access Memory (RAM)
	    A form of computer data storage. A random access device allows
	    stored data to be accessed in nearly the same amount of time for any
	    storage location, so data can be accessed quickly in any random
	    order.

	Red Hat
	    A collection of many different software programs, developed by Red
	    Hat速, Inc. and other members of the Open Source community. All
	    software programs included in Red Hat速Linux速 are GPG signed by Red
	    Hat to indicate that Red Hat supplied them.

	    See also RHEL.

	Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
	    A commercial Linux operating system produced by Red Hat速, Inc. RHEL
	    is designed to provide an Enterprise-ready Linux distribution
	    suitable to multiple target applications.

	    See also Red Hat Linux.

	Ruby
	    A dynamic, reflective, general-purpose object-oriented programming
	    language that combines syntax inspired by Perl with Smalltalk-like
	    features. Ruby originated in Japan during the mid-1990s and was
	    first developed and designed by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto. It was
	    influenced primarily by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, and Lisp. Ruby
	    supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional,
	    object oriented, imperative and reflective. It also has a dynamic
	    type system and automatic memory management; it is therefore similar
	    in varying respects to Smalltalk, Python, Perl, Lisp, Dylan, Pike,
	    and CLU.

	Secure Shell (SSH)
	    An application for secure data communication, remote shell services,
	    or command execution between networked computers. SSH utilizes a
	    server/client model for point-to-point secure communication.

	Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
	    The standard security technology for using PKI keys to provide a
	    secure channel between two servers.

	    See also TLS.

	SIMP
	    A security framework that sits on top of RHEL or CentOS.

	Transport Layer Security (TLS)
	    A cryptographic protocol that provides network communications
	    security. TLS and SSL encrypt the segments of network connections
	    above the Transport Layer, using asymmetric cryptography for privacy
	    and a keyed message authentication codes for message reliability.

	    See also SSL.

	Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)
	    A file transfer protocol generally used for automated transfer of
	    configuration or boot files between machines in a local environment.

	Virtual Machine (VM)
	    A completely isolated guest operating system installation within a
	    normal host operating system.

	Yellowdog Updater, Modified (YUM)
	    A software installation tool for Linux. It is a complete software
	    management system that works with RPM files. YUM is designed to be
	    used over a network or the Internet.
